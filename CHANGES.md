## Origin story

`kosu` was built around a Jupyter Notebook processing script we made in about 2015 to support Agile's Python classes. Our hands-on process got out of hand as we added more courses and variants to our portfolio. We started this tool in November 2021 and released it in January 2022; it represents an attempt to make the courses easier to define and manage.
